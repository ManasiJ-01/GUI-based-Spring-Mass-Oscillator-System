# Spring-Mass-Oscillator
The Spring mass oscillator GUI gives the effect of stiffness on time period. If the stiffness is less then the time period will be less and vice versa. 

A mass suspended on a spring will oscillate after being displaced. The period of oscillation is affected by the amount of mass and the stiffness of the spring. This experiment allows the period, displacement, velocity and acceleration to be investigated by datalogging the output from a motion sensor.

This project is build in Glowscript IDE which is based on visual python. It gives the 3D animation of how the stiffness is related to time period.

After changing the value of mass and stiffness, we will get the appropriate 3d animation of the same by this GUI system.
